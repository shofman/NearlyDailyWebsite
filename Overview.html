<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>There isn't much to be said about me. I'm relatively new to web programming, and can't get a job, so I need to do something in my spare time. This space is where that happens.</p>

<h1>About the Examples</h1>
<h3><a href="./Drawing-10.31.13.html">Union Jack in Canvas</a></h3>
<p>First project done with canvas graphics. Wanted to create a Union Jack flag programmatically. Not the best in the world, 
	but the javascript inside can also create the individual components - St. Andrew's Cross, St. George's Cross and St. Patrick's Cross</p>
	
<h3><a href="./Snake/snake.html">Snake</a></h3>
<p>Not a project of my own, but replicated to get experience making a simple game in HTML5. May eventually be expanded, but at present, this is just the basic game </p>

<h3><a href="./Maze/maze.html"> Recursive Maze Generator </a></h3>
<p>Since they ask you for information on recursion, I thought it would be good to practice. The maze generation bit was just a different concept to explore, particular with bit manipulation to check for walls </p>

<h3><a href="./Game of Life/life.html">Game of Life</a></h3>
<p> Conway's Classic Game, I experimented with user interface on this one, allowing the user to click on the board, and to run the game. </p>

<h3><a href="./Game of Motion/motionleveleditor.html">Motion Game</a></h3>
<p> Little game I'm creating at present. Not sure what the overall rules will be, or how fun it will be, but the concept is simple - every motion made in the same direction carries you further. Currently a level editor</p>

<h3><a href = "./WordSwap/wordswap.html">Word Swap</a></h3>
<p> Small project to experiment passing information between two canvases. Not completed, but it should be a tool to assist in finding the solution to ciphers </p>
